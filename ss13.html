            Recently i've been enthralled by an old game called Space Station 13. It was originally developed on the BYOND platform and had its code open sourced after internal development issues. Currently there are numerous fan hosted servers with upwards of 100 players.
        </p>
        <p>Ive contributed and commited to the /tg/ Space Station 13 server on several occasions. Space Station 13 provides a shockingly accurate atmospheric simulation system, which i suppose isnt too surpising as it was fist developed to be that specifically.</p>
